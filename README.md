**Switched-Mode Power Supply**. It is an electronic power supply that uses a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently from a DC or AC source to DC loads while converting voltage and current characteristics. It is substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply as the transformer is much smaller.
