# SPMS

**Switched-Mode Power Supply**. It is an electronic power supply that uses a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently from a DC or AC source to DC loads while converting voltage and current characteristics. It is substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply as the transformer is much smaller.

## Features
- **Effeciency**
  
    SMPSs are high efficiency compared to linear power supplies. They use switching components (such       as              transistors or MOSFETs) to regulate the output voltage, minimizing energy loss and heat generation.
  
- **Compact Size**

    SMPS is much smaller and lighter than traditional linear power supplies as it operate at higher                        frequencies and require smaller transformers and filtering components.
  
## Usage
- The SMSPS can be used to power consumer electronics such as smartphones, laptops, tablets etc.
- They can also be used in renewable energy systems to convert AC power generated in solar inverters into usable DC      power for electronics.
- It can alos be employed in networking equipments to provide power and maintain stable network connectivity.
